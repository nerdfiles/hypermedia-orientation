<h1>Brass Syntax</h1>
<p>Remember JSX (a cursed abomination from Facebook that exceedingly privileges DX over FX: <i>frontend experience</i>; why restrict ourselves to only humans or “people” as those engaging our tools?)? Well, aside from it being insufferable for CTags users, let’s consider an example library that would make trivial the mapping of “syntactic” (lexical; i.e. grammatical) structure (categories?) to our (in)famous URL space:</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;link rel={vm.lexicalStructure}
        href={API.affordance.www.example.com({ urlConfig })} /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Our first design assumption is that any given expression of a link relation, or thereby containing at least one, (i.e., <i>relating relation</i>; see Arianna Betti’s Against Facts) may bear truth (or be a <i>truthbearer</i>) under some hypertext referential space. As it is said, “Beauty is the givenness of data” (Contingent Computation. Beatrice M. Fazi.)</p>
<p>Getting to the point, there’s magic in them hills: <i>metanorms are expressible through unactualized actions in link relation as tendencies and capacities which really exist in the possibility space of action of the semiotic web (the gradient of semioticity).</i></p>
<p>A quickie. Imagine this link relation: <code>… rel=“A→◻◊A” …</code></p>
<p>Now… replace the Propositional Variables with hashes over which we can guarantee uniqueness (controllable reduction of collisions).</p>

<p>These “strings” we are concerned with, as “values” of the <code>[rel]</code>, I have called “non-standard link relations”: as a harmonization of François Laruelle’s “Non-standard Philosophy” and Alfred Jarry’s ’Pataphysics. A scientific formulization of Clinamen, Anomalous, Absolute, Antinomy, Pataphor and Syzygy in terms of mechanism and mechanism-structure which may be realized with in the semiotic space of possibiliity of action.</p>

<h1>Metaproblems to sell more problems</h1>
<p>What a deliciously gnarly question:</p>
<p>“Isn’t there a need for cacheing the results of the various reasoners in a FOL form?”<sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/philoweb/2014/01/15/syllogism/">syllogism</a></sup></p>
<p>But… “However, ◊◻A→A says that if A is possibly necessary, then A is the case, and this is far from obvious. Why does (B) seem obvious, while one of the things it entails seems not obvious at all? The answer is that there is a dangerous ambiguity in the English interpretation of A→◻◊A.”</p>
<p>We need to adapt this question to account for the understanding that the English, as much as any other language, involves ambiguity: we cannot just throw FOL into the web space; to adjust:</p>
<p>Isn’t there a need for cacheing the results of the various reasons in First-order modal Logic (as well as Free Logic, Intuitionistic and other non-classical logics which might include “domain functions,” etc. such that assignments are made to each possible world its own domain)?</p>
<p>Indeed, the web may never be unified according to facts: there is no ultimate language (François Laruelle). At most, we have correlational matrices from which to model domains in the web’s possibility space of action.</p>

<p>minimal tropological evidence of causality; I do not have a theory, but perhaps I can convince, as Yuji Ijiri does in accounting practice, that <em>link relations are causal relations</em> in semantic web (development). This must be a technological achievement before systematic space exploration is possible, inasmuch as hypermedia safety, hypermedia idempotence, hypermedia mutability and hypermedia navigability would be necessary and sufficient conditions for describing the modes of causality: first, formal, efficient and final cause, as well as Peirce’s Fourthness: first, second, third and fourth, as completion, conclusion, emergence, deduction.</p>

Before moving on, a user agent may analyze the given document for clues as to what to do next. At every link relation is a “stored action” (or “potential action”) ready to fire. Why should the user agent choose it over some other by a sequential order?

<p>“next” is pretty straight-forward: assuming your API already has business logic and sufficient context. Okay, maybe it isn’t so straight-forward, but most typically, the bare minimum is that in the response, “next” should do something reasonable, and in an excellent world: it would do so atomically, consistently, in isolation and durably. At a grocery store, “next” could mean something different for the item, the customer, the isle, and so on, for every thing that can be given in affordance. Elsewhere, at a baseball field, “next” could mean the player to bat, or next inning, or “take/move to/etc” the next base.</p>

<p>Those previous examples could all be called “mereological simplexes”: they arguably require no grammatical (or lexical) analysis, but do require syntactic analysis. The presumption of grammar between a character is exactly what we do not wish to assume. Its existence must be determined through causal discovery.

<p>
Adding to the explanation of emergence a mechanism-independent component will involve introducing entirely new ideas so it will be useful at this point to justify the need for the extra complexity. So far the concept of emergence has played an ontological role, showing why it is legitimate to believe in the existence of objective properties, tendencies, and capacities. But once we add the mechanism-independent component the concept of emergence leads to two important epistemological consequences: it explains why we can use partial models to learn about reality and it provides an account for the capacity of those models to mimic the behavior of the processes they model. The first consequence derives directly from the notion of asymptotic stability. When the emergent properties of a whole are stable they can survive changes in the details of the interactions between its parts.

<p>
Being able to take for granted the existence of emergent properties at one scale in order to explain properties at another scale is arguably a basic requirement for scientific research. If scientists had to build models that captured all scales simultaneously no scientific field would ever have succeeded in explaining anything. We would be trapped in a block universe in which every aspect is inextricably related to every other aspect and our incapacity to separate levels of emergence would leave us cognitively powerless.
</p>
<p>
The second epistemological consequence derives from the very notion of mechanism-independence: if processes as different in detail as a convection cell and a chemical clock can exhibit the same behavior perhaps mathematical equations can also display that behavior.

The mechanism-independent component of an explanation, on the other hand, demands clarifying the status of tendencies and capacities when they are not actually manifested or exercised.
