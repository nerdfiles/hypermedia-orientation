<h1>Brass Syntax</h1>
<p>Remember JSX (a cursed abomination from Facebook that exceedingly privileges DX over FX: <i>frontend experience</i>; why restrict ourselves to only humans or “people” as those engaging our tools?)? Well, aside from it being insufferable for CTags users, let’s consider an example library that would make trivial the mapping of “syntactic” (lexical; i.e. grammatical) structure (categories?) to our (in)famous URL space:</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;link rel={vm.lexicalStructure}
        href={API.affordance.www.example.com({ urlConfig })} /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Our first design assumption is that any given expression of a link relation, or thereby containing at least one, (i.e., <i>relating relation</i>; see Arianna Betti’s Against Facts) may bear truth (or be a <i>truthbearer</i>) under some hypertext referential space. As it is said, “Beauty is the givenness of data” (Contingent Computation. Beatrice M. Fazi.)</p>
<p>Getting to the point, there’s magic in them hills: <i>metanorms are expressible through unactualized actions in link relation as tendencies and capacities which really exist in the possibility space of action of the semiotic web (the gradient of semioticity).</i></p>
<p>A quickie. Imagine this link relation: <code>… rel=“A→◻◊A” …</code></p>
<p>Now… replace the Propositional Variables with hashes over which we can guarantee uniqueness (controllable reduction of collisions).</p>

<p>Abstract Link Relations (or, elsewhere said: “non-standard link relations” hypothesized to bear truth, if not the sentence-subject, from immanent algebraic and algorithmic structure of strings of link relation; think medium specificity a la Fazi). Other examples?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>Any terminal commands</li>
<li>YUML</li>

<li>SDRSes, DeLandan simulational languages, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>These languages can be interpretted in a non-denumerable many ways. So the context-freeness has to be given anywhere markup potentially tends away from the event of its decision bound to interactive exteriority conditioning the possibility for its emergence.</p>
<p>Non-standard Link Relation concerns how we transindividuate affordances through metasymbolic expression of interiority/exteriority, universality/particiularity, relata-specificty insofar as we define pre-configuration, pre-organizational structure immanent to mechanism and mechanism-independent structure, properties, tendency and capacity in metacomputational and non-metacomputational procedure.</p>

<p>There is of course a “cache” that resides in various intermediaries: we may systematically analyze these strings using “context units” (in much the same way the “Context Object” improved on the Event Loop Design Pattern<a href="https://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/Context-Object-Pattern.pdf">co</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Context units store the activation values of all the hidden units at a given time <em>t</em> and make these values available as inputs at the subsequence cycle <em>t</em> + 1. Since information about the hidden units at <em>t</em> is available as an input at <em>t</em> + 1, and since these values, in turn affect the values of the hidden units at <em>t</em> +2, the context units provide the net with the ability to encode a memory of a whole sequence of inputs.

<p>These “strings” we are concerned with, as “values” of the <code>[rel]</code>, I have called “non-standard link relations”: as a harmonization of François Laruelle’s “Non-standard Philosophy” and Alfred Jarry’s ’Pataphysics.

<p>What a deliciously gnarly question:</p>
<p>“Isn’t there a need for cacheing the results of the various reasoners in a FOL form?”<sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/philoweb/2014/01/15/syllogism/">syllogism</a></sup></p>
<p>But… “However, ◊◻A→A says that if A is possibly necessary, then A is the case, and this is far from obvious. Why does (B) seem obvious, while one of the things it entails seems not obvious at all? The answer is that there is a dangerous ambiguity in the English interpretation of A→◻◊A.”</p>
<p>We need to adapt this question to account for the understanding that the English, as much as any other language, involves ambiguity: we cannot just throw FOL into the web space; to adjust:</p>
<p>Isn’t there a need for cacheing the results of the various reasons in First-order modal Logic (as well as Free Logic, Intuitionistic and other non-classical logics which might include “domain functions,” etc. such that assignments are made to each possible world its own domain)?</p>
<p>Indeed, the web may never be unified according to facts: there is no ultimate language (François Laruelle). At most, we have correlational matrices from which to model domains in the web’s possibility space of action.</p>

At a grocery store, “next” could mean something different for the item, the customer, the isle, and so on, for every thing that can be given in affordance.

Adding to the explanation of emergence a mechanism-independent component will involve introducing entirely new ideas so it will be useful at this point to justify the need for the extra complexity. So far the concept of emergence has played an ontological role, showing why it is legitimate to believe in the existence of objective properties, tendencies, and capacities. But once we add the mechanism-independent component the concept of emergence leads to two important epistemological consequences: it explains why we can use partial models to learn about reality and it provides an account for the capacity of those models to mimic the behavior of the processes they model. The first consequence derives directly from the notion of asymptotic stability. When the emergent properties of a whole are stable they can survive changes in the details of the interactions between its parts.

Being able to take for granted the existence of emergent properties at one scale in order to explain properties at another scale is arguably a basic requirement for scientific research. If scientists had to build models that captured all scales simultaneously no scientific field would ever have succeeded in explaining anything. We would be trapped in a block universe in which every aspect is inextricably related to every other aspect and our incapacity to separate levels of emergence would leave us cognitively powerless.
</p>
<p>
The second epistemological consequence derives from the very notion of mechanism-independence: if processes as different in detail as a convection cell and a chemical clock can exhibit the same behavior perhaps mathematical equations can also display that behavior.

<p>
If this scenario is correct we can conclude that the possibility space that was searched through evolution, both biological and cultural, was isomorphic with but not identical to the space studied by automata theory. Automata theory charts the space of possible languages and of the computational capacities needed to master them in an entirely mechanism-independent way involving no commitment to any particular implementation of the automata themselves. This point is often overlooked by those who think our brains must embody a genetically coded linear-bounded automaton using an explicit context-sensitive “language of thought.”

<h1>Agrilogistics is Easy Think Substance</h1>

<p>
Agrilogistics is Easy Think spacetime. A one-size-fits-all depression temporality, a sad rigid thin gray tube. We are living inside depression objectified in built space. It’s in the way gigantic fields of rapeseed extend everywhere. It’s in the way huge lonely front lawns extend a meaningless one-size-fits-all statement about individuality. It’s in the way malls have gigantic parking lots, and housing lots have giant McMansions without so much as a garden. With its tiny temporality window, agrilogistic depression has turned the surface of Earth into a fatal place. Not only the land but also the oceans, which are the unconscious of the built space, the toilet where the chemicals go. As we have seen, there is a simple Freudian term for a fatal compulsion that keeps on retweeting: <i>death drive</i>.

<h1>Forgiving Semiotic Dynamics</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
In semiotic dynamics, for example, the original plurality of idiosyncratic vocabularies is slowly narrowed down to a single shared lexicon by the tendency of agents to choose symbolic artifacts according to how referentially successful they have been in the past. And similarly for the simulation of label concatenation as a means to express causality: every generation has a tendency to start with those monolithic sentences that were more predictive of the real link between moon phase and tide state, and this acts a bottleneck facilitating the passage of some but not other artifacts to the next generation.

<p>
Once metanorms had become part of the cultural content that was transmitted from one generation to the next their use could have been extended to patterns of behavior that distinguished one community from another. In other words, metanorms could have become a mechanism not only for the emergence of solidarity and a sense of communal identity but also for the enforcement of behavioral patterns that were unique to a community and consolidated that identity.
