# Brass Syntax

Remember JSX (a cursed abomination from Facebook that exceedingly privileges 
DX over FX: <i>frontend experience</i>; why restrict ourselves to only humans 
or "people" as those engaging our tools?)? Well, aside from it being 
insufferable for CTags users, let's consider an example library that would 
make trivial the mapping of "syntactic" (lexical; i.e. grammatical) structure 
(categories?) to our (in)famous URL space:

```
  <link rel={vm.lexicalStructure}
        href={API.affordance.www.example.com({ urlConfig })} />
```

Our first design assumption is that any given expression of a link relation,
or thereby containing at least one, (i.e., <i>relating relation</i>; see 
Arianna Betti's Against Facts) may bear truth (or be a <i>truthbearer</i>) 
under some hypertext referential space. As it is said, "Beauty is the 
givenness of data" (Contingent Computation. Beatrice M. Fazi.)

Getting to the point, there's magic in them hills: <i>metanorms are 
expressible through unactualized actions in link relation as tendencies and 
capacities which really exist in the possibility space of action of the 
semiotic web (the gradient of semioticity).</i>

A quickie. Imagine this link relation: <code>... rel="A→◻◊A" ...</code>

Now... replace the Propositional Variables with hashes over which we can 
guarantee uniqueness (controllable reduction of collisions).

# Metaproblems to sell more problems

Abstract Link Relations (or, elsewhere said: "non-standard link relations" 
hypothesized to bear truth, if not the sentence-subject, from immanent 
algebraic and algorithmic structure of strings of link relation; think medium 
specificity a la Fazi). Other examples?

1. XDIMessages
2. Any terminal commands 
3. YUML
4. ASCII 
5. Modal FOL (S5, S4, doxastic logics, epistemic logics, temporal logics, etc.)
6. Sheet music (and degradations: guitar tabs, etc.)
7. CoRAL[coral]
8. SDRSes, DeLandan simulational languages, etc.

These languages can be interpretted in a non-denumerable many ways. So the 
context-freeness has to be given anywhere markup potentially tends away from 
the event of its decision bound to interactive exteriority conditioning the 
possibility for its emergence.

Non-standard Link Relation concerns how we transindividuate affordances through 
metasymbolic expression of interiority/exteriority, 
universality/particiularity, relata-specificty insofar as we define 
pre-configuration, pre-organizational structure immanent to mechanism and 
mechanism-independent structure, properties, tendency and capacity in 
metacomputational and non-metacomputational procedure.

*Programmable possibility spaces* much? Programmable semioticity? Programmable 
solidarity? Productivity? Compositionality? Systematicity? etc.

# Metaproblems to sell more problems

There is of course a "cache" that resides in various intermediaries: we may 
systematically analyze these strings using "context units" (in much the same 
way the "Context Object" improved on the Event Loop Design Pattern[co]).

<blockquote><p>Context units store the activation values of all the hidden 
units at a given time *t* and make these values available as inputs at the 
subsequence cycle *t* + 1. Since information about the hidden units at *t* is 
available as an input at *t* + 1, and since these values, in turn affect the 
values of the hidden units at *t* +2, the context units provide the net with 
the ability to encode a memory of a whole sequence of inputs.</p>

# Metaproblems to sell more problems

How to code for dealing with mistakes ("apologies") in interpretations that the net gives?

<blockquote><p>When the background process detects an inconsistency in the results produced 
by the foreground system (e.g., because a “guess” turns out to be mistaken), 
it can then take corrective action by generating an “apology.”</p>
<div><cite>"Consistency Analysis in Bloom: a CALM and Collected Approach" <sup>[calm]</sup></cite></div></blockquote>

The Discovery Layer starts at <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code><sup>[rfc2616]</sup>: <i>finding 
systematic tasks</i> (again, even though the hypermedia web is a "cognitive-like" 
possibility space, we do not necessarily have to only take Fodor's model of 
cognition: instead of methods, we discover "systematic tasks" for integration 
into our neat little Risk Traits model, which should cover a range of mental 
models of identity<sup>[mmi]</sup>).

# Metaproblems to sell more problems

<blockquote><p>The net was then tested for its ability to detect this 
grammatical structure with strings that were not in the training set. The net 
correctly predicted what the legal continuations of novel input strings would 
be in agreement with the grammar.</p>
<div><cite>Cognition without Classical Architecture. Garson, James.<sup>[cog]</sup>
</cite></div></blockquote>

These "strings" we are concerned with, as "values" of the <code>[rel]</code>, 
I have called "non-standard link relations": as a harmonization of François 
Laruelle's "Non-standard Philosophy" and Alfred Jarry's 'Pataphysics. A 
scientific formulization of Clinamen, Anomalous, Absolute, Antinomy, Pataphor 
and Syzygy in terms of mechanism and mechanism-structure which may be realized 
with in the semiotic space of possibiliity of action.

# Metaproblems to sell more problems

What a deliciously gnarly question:

"Isn’t there a need for cacheing the results of the various reasoners in a FOL 
form?"<sup>[syllogism]</sup>

But... "However, ◊◻A→A says that if A is possibly necessary, then A is the 
case, and this is far from obvious. Why does (B) seem obvious, while one of 
the things it entails seems not obvious at all? The answer is that there is a 
dangerous ambiguity in the English interpretation of A→◻◊A."

We need to adapt this question to account for the understanding that the 
English, as much as any other language, involves ambiguity: we cannot just 
throw FOL into the web space; to adjust:

Isn't there a need for cacheing the results of the various reasons in 
First-order modal Logic (as well as Free Logic, Intuitionistic and other 
non-classical logics which might include "domain functions," etc. such that 
assignments are made to each possible world its own domain)?

Indeed, the web may never be unified according to facts: there is no ultimate 
language (François Laruelle). At most, we have correlational matrices from 
which to model domains in the web's possibility space of action.

# Metaproblems to sell more problems

Recall some of the Hard Problem(s) of Computer Science:

```
    1. Naming things
    2. Cache invalidation
    7. Async programming
    3. Off-by-one errors
```

Such a question checks every problem, and then some!

# Metaproblems to sell more problems

Isn't ANSI C interpreted, anyway? But truly, we have serious objectives:

1. "The Need for Speed, 23 Years Later"<sup>[ns]</sup>
   "Delays of just 1 second are enough to interrupt a person’s conscious 
   thought process"  
2. Shouldn't the cached results of reasons be navigable, transclusive, safe, 
   (im)mutable and still idempotent?  
3. Potentiation: link relations provide the conditions for the possibility of  
   superpositional acquaintance with data.  
4. Interplanetary REST: some form of Creative Intelligence must be 
   demonstrated before interplanetary communicational texture is realized, as 
   web navigability, tranclusion, (im)mutability, safety and idempotence 
   afford for us a manifold corpus, if not a metaphysics of literature, from 
   which to deploy analysis: a shift from "representation"; and so too, from 
   "understanding" to recognition, from "composition" to (mereological) 
   complexity, from "inference" to causality). 

Our goal is to exploit the conditions for the possibility of attention (filter, 
neurological, spotlight, premotor) as a 
metaphorical construct, as much as metonymical, synechdocical and ironic 
constructs are realized from the nature of the inherent metaphorical nature of 
attention: as a spotlight, under certain mechanism-dependent structure, and as 
a "vision," under the circumstances or simulations of mechanism-independent 
structure[attn].

# A web science needs some ...

minimal tropological evidence of causality; I do not have a theory, but perhaps I 
can convince, as Yuji Ijiri does in accounting practice, that *link 
relations are causal relations* in semantic web (development). This must be 
a technological achievement before systematic space exploration is possible, 
inasmuch as hypermedia safety, hypermedia idempotence, hypermedia 
mutability and hypermedia navigability would be necessary and sufficient 
conditions for describing the modes of causality: first, formal, efficient 
and final cause, as well as Peirce's Fourthness: first, second, third and 
fourth, as completion, conclusion, emergence, deduction.

We aspire to develop computational completition, conclusion, emergence and 
deduction from hypermedia as the engine of application state.

# A web science needs some...

Think of every <...> as a mode. It can follow from any number of attributes; 
in our case, we want to formally express a connection between meta-relation 
and web. Meta-data is fine: meta-relations take departure from the scaffold 
of meta-data. They have extra-linguistic significance: but what world do they
pick out? At least a blockchain makes that significance a conveyor-tube we 
can perform global consensus on!

Do you really want systems built for global consensus to be applied to 
interplanetary communication? Hardly!

# No Blockchain? No Problem

Blockchains are not scale-free because they do not begin from hypermedia-orientation.

Look at a transaction's JSON: do you see any links? No. Addresses, Hashes... Big deal!

It's got "nested" structure, and even "values": but we need relata-specificity (link 
relation as <i>relating relation</i> inasmuch as we consider <i>perceptual 
relations as causal relations</i>).

For ODRL, Linked Data Proofs[ld-proof] validation logic use CASL with Seneca, 
etc. For the GUID, has the object that is being posted or use REST extended 
with a queue mechanism for de-duping and use the sequence ID as the input for 
the hash, place in a DHT for processing by the peer network depending on the type of resource that it
presupposes: mining, agriculture, manufacturing and construction resources will 
require a certain number of nodes to generating a sufficient number of 
confirmations to determine its ontological integrity in order to counter 
*fragmentation*. How do we deal with change ossification in networked resource 
substrates (whatever is subtending the afforded capabilities across the 
commandspace)?

# LINKS

The web is about LINKS! A network's becoming scale-free consists in links being 
the building blocks, or building constituency, of its reality. Its boundary is 
necessarily fuzzy, its borders could be playing Hackenbush or Nomic, or Nomic 
Hackenbush! Who knows! The properties of free-scale are coded safety, 
idempotence, mutability and navigability.

# Emergence

But this substrate emerges from the robustness of <i>interactive exteriority</i>.

How can we teach the web to play with itself? To jack off? Even when we're not looking?

# Thinking Money

All that blather about "money" being "durable," "globally transferrable," 
"fungible," "divisible," "store of value"... rubbish!

Money is a nonhuman living hyperobject that preexisted market economy: it must 
be safe, idempotent, mutable and transclusive.

# Thinking Money

- Thinking money involves transclusion: insight into the future, what will be 
  bought, how it might feel.
- Thinking money involves mutability: it can evolve or not depending on context.
- Thinking money involves idempotency: money is use in ecology.
- Thinking money involves safety: we imagine the limits of its effects, and  
  our functional ultimacy.

# Acts and Dramas

An opportunity before us: a web is not (just) beautiful.

It is horrorific to imagine Creative Intelligence. What is intelligence but a 
sum of a lot of parts organized into a historico-logical structure that breeds 
consciousness before me? It is between a self that one expresses one's intelligence.

Yet if those parts, constituents, could escape from a subscending w/hole and 
non-mechanically (non-standard mechanically) bring about effects in others by 
inducing changes within their upper ontology's given motility of actual occasion?

# Acts and Dramas

Is intelligence in content or in form? How can we make sense of "intelligible 
contingency" such that modal force (having a property) is logically prior to 
temporality (holding a property) in API affordance? Let's keep it hybrid:

1. forms-from-facts
2. forms-from-mereological-complexes
3. forms-from-content
4. forms-from-content-in-structure
5. forms-from-content-in-structural-link-relation
6. code-from-content-in-structural-link-relation
7. everything-is-already-coded-from-content-in-structural-link-relation

What stops us from writing

```
  rel="<form>...</form>"
```

Well the parser, but now we can predict forms within the syntactic space and 
perform computation at the local context without requesting the specified 
<code>[href]</code>, assuming that the client implements, say, a [P2Pweb][p2pweb] 
portal. Or even embeddeding HTML is a non-hypermedia-type:

```
  {{beginning_header_of_file}}
  <html>...</html>
  {{ending_header_of_file}}
  {{rest_of_file}}
```

Or in SVG, we can embed DOM behaviors within a <a href="https://twitter.com/dualyticalchemy/status/1283195024449183746/photo/1"><code>&lt;foreignObject&gt;</code></a> 
such that the content negotiation pre-figuration can allow for rendering SVG 
with capabilities locally from the file system or simply render a web page if 
opened through HTTP: normalization and uniformity of the URL allows for these 
capabilities to be expressible in a non-dual way (unilaterally dualyzed functions).

# Hypermedia in Nouns and Verbs

We already understand the concept of "action" at the protocol level. We want "
action" to live along side the intertextual plane of consistency of the 
hypertext. Before moving on, a user agent may analyze the given document for 
clues as to what to do next. At every link relation is a "stored action" (or 
"potential action") ready to fire. Why should the user agent choose it over 
some other by a sequential order? In the manner of HTML's norms, whatever 
`[rel]` chosen conforms to a pre-established harmony, if you will, that says 
"prefetch" fires before "stylesheet," etc.

# Hypermedia in Nouns and Verbs

However, we want the opportunity to distribute and decentralize the expression 
of relata-specificity and leave "meaning" to whomever runs the repsonse to the 
request (expression): it could be one head, or a massively coordinated soup of 
stars and spokes, everywhere between a completing, concluding, deducing or 
emerging compute.

Or, we might say: let's make meaning programmable! Programmable semantics?! 
Programmable semantic web!!

# Think IFTTT for CRISPR

Link relations can get messy, but let's start simple:

1. "next" (standard)
2. "next-next" (maybe non-standard?)
3. "up and previous"
4. "between/door"

# Think IFTTT for CRISPR

"next" is pretty straight-forward: assuming your API already has business 
logic and sufficient context. Okay, maybe it isn't so straight-forward, but 
most typically, the bare minimum is that in the response, "next" should do 
something reasonable, and in an excellent world: it would do so atomically, 
consistently, in isolation and durably. At a grocery store, "next" could mean 
something different for the item, the customer, the isle, and so on, for every 
thing that can be given in affordance. Elsewhere, at a baseball field, "next" 
could mean the player to bat, or next inning, or "take/move to/etc" the next base.

# Think IFTTT for CRISPR

Those previous examples could all be called "mereological simplexes": they 
arguably require no grammatical (or lexical) analysis, but do require 
syntactic analysis. The presumption of grammar between a character is exactly 
what we do not wish to assume. Its existence must be determined through causal 
discovery. Link relations as such can possess internal relation: a link 
relation can be about the parent document, or it can be about itself, or 
really anything (assuming the identifier within the string to be analyzed in 
the link relation can be treated systematically)

# Think IFTTT for CRISPR

Is your experience of the color blue the same as mine? Well, starting from somewhere, 
some API can give us the answer, assuming we are willing to mediate our experience
through computation's own experience. Recall: the response doesn't have to give us 
anything. It could 500 error out. Or your input might be corrupted in transit, by 
bitflipping, and you might told "no." Or, given your preference settings, however 
derived, the "page" (window) to the actual occasion of our asking will have an 
answer pre-formed for us.

# Understating Hypermedia

<blockquote><p>
Hypermedia: for REST services, hypermedia helps frontends to be more 
<i>independent</i> of service endpoints. (my emphasis)
</p></blockquote>

Oftentimes hypermedia-orientation is mentioned but not emphasized. What is the 
most important, operative term here?

What does <i>independence</i> fundamentally mean?

# Understating Hypermedia

Let's take a detour, Philosophy and Simulation (Manuel DeLanda):

<blockquote><p>Yet despite these differences a convection cell and a chemical 
clock, as these reactions are called, are qualitatively the same. This implies 
that a full explanation of these emergent entities must possess a component 
that is independent of any particular mechanism.</p><div><cite>Philosophy and Simulation<sup>[philandsim]</sup><cite></div></blockquote>

# Understating Hypermedia

<blockquote><p>Adding to the explanation of emergence a mechanism-independent 
component will involve introducing entirely new ideas so it will be useful at 
this point to justify the need for the extra complexity. So far the concept of 
emergence has played an ontological role, showing why it is legitimate to 
believe in the existence of objective properties, tendencies, and capacities. 
But once we add the mechanism-independent component the concept of emergence 
leads to two important epistemological consequences: it explains why we can 
use partial models to learn about reality and it provides an account for the 
capacity of those models to mimic the behavior of the processes they model. 
The first consequence derives directly from the notion of asymptotic 
stability. When the emergent properties of a whole are stable they can survive 
changes in the details of the interactions between its parts.</p><div>
<cite>Philosophy and Simulation<cite></div></blockquote>

# Understating Hypermedia

<blockquote><p>Being able to take for granted the existence of emergent 
properties at one scale in order to explain properties at another scale is 
arguably a basic requirement for scientific research. If scientists had to 
build models that captured all scales simultaneously no scientific field would 
ever have succeeded in explaining anything. We would be trapped in a block 
universe in which every aspect is inextricably related to every other aspect 
and our incapacity to separate levels of emergence would leave us cognitively 
powerless.</p>
<p>The second epistemological consequence derives from the very notion of 
mechanism-independence: if processes as different in detail as a convection 
cell and a chemical clock can exhibit the same behavior perhaps mathematical 
equations can also display that behavior.</p>
<div><cite>Philosophy and Simulation</cite></div></blockquote>

# Understating Hypermedia

<blockquote href="note"><p>The mechanism-independent component of an explanation, on the 
other hand, demands clarifying the status of tendencies and capacities when 
they are not actually manifested or exercised. We could, of course, 
characterize that status as that of a possibility but that would be too vague: 
an unmanifested tendency and an unexercised capacity are not just possible but 
define a concrete space of possibilities with a definite structure.</p>
<div><cite>Philosophy and Simulation</cite></div></blockquote>

# Understating Hypermedia

So what's this all about? 

What are some other properties of a network which tug our sense of 
"independence" (or, what is actually "mechanism-independent structure")? What are the signs of a <i>healthy network</i>?

In the context of the computational sciences (what was once called merely 
"Computer Science"): <i>coordination-free</i>, <i>scale-free</i>, <i>identification-free</i>

# Understating Hypermedia

Here we bring together DeLanda's justifications for <i>mechanism-independent 
structure</i> and Alvaro et al.'s concept of <i>consistency as logical 
monotonicity</i>; but not (just) these ideas: we also want to fuck shit 
up with neural networks (specifically, syntactically trained recurrent nets.

<strong>Hold onto your ifs and buts?</strong> (Though it should be fairly obvious where this is headed...)

# Understating Hypermedia

We're not going full Language of Thought (LOT):

<blockquote><p>If this scenario is correct we can conclude that the 
possibility space that was searched through evolution, both biological and 
cultural, was isomorphic with but not identical to the space studied by 
automata theory. Automata theory charts the space of possible languages and of 
the computational capacities needed to master them in an entirely 
mechanism-independent way involving no commitment to any particular 
implementation of the automata themselves. This point is often overlooked by 
those who think our brains must embody a genetically coded linear-bounded 
automaton using an explicit context-sensitive "language of thought."

# Hypermedia or Hyperobject?

possible to cast toward specificity. But what interests us here is the act of

# Transcendental Games, Nomic, Latin Octonions, Metalogic Alphabet, etc. and the Agrilogistic Axiology

So what's the upshot of all this? It is our infinite task to turn civilization 
from dogmatic agrilogistic science given to us by Aristotle. We must not allow 
for river ponds and verdant greens be replaced by shopping malls and 
blockchains. Capitalism is nothing but the upshot of money afforded an 
agrilogistic science. There's little we can do about it barging through the 
front door. Even Game-B may be for naught.

# Agrilogistic Science is Easy Think Substance

<blockquote><p>Agrilogistics is Easy Think spacetime. A one-size-fits-all

Bence Nanay, Sebastien Rödl, Timothy Morton, etc. are touching the same 
difficulty: modal force is logically prior to temporality, templexity, etc. 
However, how do we imagine ourselves imagining modal facts if we are 
constrained to a technology of understanding grounded in spatial metaphors? 
How can the outside, interactive exteriority, be described, or better: where 
should it be expressed?

# Agrilogistic Science is Easy Think Substance

My hypothesis is that its expression will take place in link relation of the 
actual occasion of web pages; it doesn't really matter the protocol or media 
type. There is no such thing as a "problem of spacetime" since the outside is 
logically prior to spacetime. To show this, computational procedure will need 
to obviously keep secrets, but in this case: secrets are logically prior to 
magical belief. Computation, then, would be conditioned to induce the 
properties of a post-human mathematics (its perceptual states inclusive of its 
own computational history). 

But is there any logical, factual or mental evidence that determines what a 
symbol means when computational expression, or elaboration, takes place?

# Agrilogistic Science is Easy Think Substance

Microsoft et al. are obviously, just as well, terrified of "private languages" 
so defined, or founded, through the agrilogistic lens. Can we program the 
field of vision, etc.? Program death? Or desire? Even dreams? To what end, why 
should the shadows of the cave, indeed the darkness deeper within, not be the 
edges of chaos, rather than our mere perceptual states? Is the author is a 
wish from the outside-text? Arriving to the end of history, being there the 
will of the author speaks a grave situated as if not the expanse of the 
graveyard of the possible. Shadows indeed, but internalized horror -- why 
should the horror, even the longing, or the melancholy, drive out the vision? 
Why would any depth of the cave necessarily condition us to internalize horror 
out of darkness if we indeed had been designed through the cave itself? Why 
should a cave care if we are present or not? Can we see the cave for its 
rocks? Could we ever? How would the evolutionary tale speak for the threat 
ecology of the cave, if it were that shadows were its deepest threat? A cave 
of refuge, sanctuary, dreams. Whole epochs given without givenness in caves, 
the dark becoming both protector and capacitor of and for a realm of toy 
shadows and toy temporalities: <i>the surrealm of toy modalities</i>.

Ok, evolutionary Nash optimization only game theory. But also, remember 
dynamical systems theory and semiotics? John Nash Jr. compares "water" to 
"money": this is an agrilogistic trick. It's pre-scientific metaphysics, at 
best poetry. What does water reveal of the hidden of nature, and what does 
money reveal? Does water reveal to use the structure of human social organization?
Does water indicate to us some emergent structure of our social cognition? Have we 
ever sought out and fought wars over water in such a way that water itself 
became the deciding factor determined in the last instance toward the 
resulting outcome of any such war?

Could Twin Earth water ever pick out money? Or vice versa? What of Twin Earth 
money? Is it conceivable, or an impossible object?

# Forget Game Theory

There is no monetary fact our evolutionary history that determines value when 
we exchange things. What of modal facts? Is money ultimately serve an 
"artifact function" or a "biological function" (Bence Nanay).

If we want to reduce the communist and the anticommunist to merely "schemers," 
which must first distinguish these labels: do they pick out biological or 
artifact functions? Do they pick out the same kind of function, assuming as 
such that they are no more than ontologically indistinguishable "schemers" 
(indiscernability of identicals). Are "communist" and "anticommunist" merely 
oppositional categories to ourselves, or at they inherently antagonistic? Do 
these meaning-tags cover no more than biological and artificial worlds of 
world-thought? Is there more to our world than biological and artificial 
interactions; are capacities and tendencies themselves functions? We may grant 
this, but under which category to they fall: biological or artifact? Or are 
they the very conditions through which the biological and artificial are 
grounded in perceptual states? Functions, regardless of their ontological 
commitments, may very will be analyzable in terms of their decay; however 
money decays, it may be coded, yet the model of the interactive exteriority 
which founds these hyperobjects. To say the least, everything eats: water 
decomposes various things just as much as money. We may chart out how these 
agents and interactions maintain a parity with each other, as much as 
equations themselves and the natural laws contingently condition each other in 
the expression of computational procedure.

# Forget Game Theory

Our task is the interplay of the communist and the anticommunist, as much as 
the interplay of water and money, extension and thought.

The attribute of thought and the attribute of extension, just schemers? Hardly.

Why would we even want a theory that sees "political antagonism" as mere 
opposition as water and money are merely opposed? Before that, why would we 
even desire a description of the world that supposes an equivalence relation 
as if it were more real than the entities being supposed to contribute to its 
expression? As Arianna Betti asks, "Why is it desirable not to introduce new 
entities merely for the sake of solving a problem?" (Against Facts).

# Forget Game Theory

The thing supposed by Nash is a "miraculous energy source." But I thought we 
were moving in the direction of probabilistic knowledge as a grounding for 
scientific abductive reasoning? Not more "iconic" metaphysics, pyramids and the like. 

We must first account for modal forces through the composition of modal 
mereological complexes, prior to any ontologization of time. The scientific 
image (water) and the manifest image (money) are to be distinguished through modal 
properties, not merely the A Series (or even the B Series, C Series E/D Series). 
The unreality of time, or our impossibility to demonstrate how any series 
involves change conditions that we may include change itself in our ontology 
as fundamental, a first-class ontological commitment. What we require, then, 
is a syntax of and for change: the syntax of the real. In this way we open the 
possibility of the communist and anticommunist to be not merely distinguished 
through their temporal manifestations but so to their modal properties. Money 
requires a political criterion of alterity, water does not; it goes without 
saying: you couldn't even eat <i>ideal money</i>. So why suppose that the 
decay of value-form (artifact function; conventional sign) and the 
natural-form (biological function; natural sign) just are in a parity as the 
real constituents themselves, as if <i>more real</i> than the constituents 
themselves?

Ae they say, it's not your money until you spend it: credit and credit alone is 
money.

# Forget Game Theory

Do water and money even "malfunction" in the same way, by the same manner with 
similar consequences? If mental states, or perceptual states, are 
individuation dependent on the outside (interactive exteriority) to what 
extent is any allegedly existing possible world not subsumed to the very 
possibility of the interactive exteriority? Or not merely an extension of the 
actual world through its actual occasion. Only the actual is real, therefore, 
the individuation of our terms is not merely brought about their change but 
our ability to predict change. Change is the outside; not that the past and 
the present are outside of the present. Our technology of understanding the 
past, present and future is conditioned by an imagination, an analytic 
imaginary, that is given itself without givenness: contingent computation. 
Intelligible contingency is logically prior to time; however conceived: Modal 
Time is logically prior to the * Series, just as <i>aisthetics grounds logic</i>,
or, in Marxist rhetoric: developmental relations (i.e., aisthetic relations) 
"congeal" into the logical relations (congealed abstract labor codified in the 
superstrucure), such that contradictions do not take place in the base 
structure but in changes which are <i>ossified</i> in the superstructure 
(i.e., logical relations)).

Don't fall for it! Avert agrilogistic substitution! We can't just go about 
theorizing that shopping malls and riverponds are interchangeable just on 
account of being ex-changeable. We must re-imagine relation without exchange, 
as Laruelle would argue.

Are symmetries preserved after quantization? Particularly those symmetrical 
relations of markets which condition the possibility of exchange? Are markets 
only ever equilibrium-bound asymptotically?
